Use-case 01: Deploy SSL enabled App-service with AS3
====================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Deploy-SSL-Enabled-App_Services.yaml is a templated Ansible playbook that utilizes AS3 that demonstrates configuring SSL termination and SSL re-direct for your application on F5 BIG-IP. 

Using this template, we will create an SSL enabled (on port 443) application service (Virtual IP or VIP) on F5 BIG-IP and also create the associative Port 80 SSL redirect for that Virtual IP. If there is an already existing application service (VIP) that was previously deployed without SSL (a very common scenario), this template will also enable SSL (open SSL port) on that Virtual IP address.

The certificates used in this template for SSL termination are self-signed certs that are generated on the BIG-IP. Users will be able to swap out the self-signed certs very easily and we will demonstrate how in 'certificate-replacement' template that will follow.

RUN THE TEMPLATE
----------------
Running this template assumes that a F5 BIG-IP instance, necessary webservers and Ansible node are available.  


1. Login to the Ansible Host

2. Change Directory in the Ansible Host to the use-cases repo previously downloaded

   .. code::
   
      cd ~/f5-bd-ansible-labs/201-F5-Advanced/AS3/01-Deploy-SSL-Enabled-App_Services-AS3/

3. Run the Ansible Playbook ‘Deploy-SSL-Enabled-App_Services.yaml’:

   .. code::
   
      ansible-navigator run Deploy-SSL-Enabled-App_Services.yaml --mode stdout

4. Verify the F5 Configuration

BIG-IP - (https://F5-BIG-IP-Public-IP:8443) - get the F5-BIG-IP-Public-IP from instructor_inventory file in provisioning host.
- Login to the BIG-IP instance
- Change the Partition from Common to "Ansible Workshops"
- Navigate to Local traffic->Virtual server
- Ensure there are 2 VIPs with same IP

  - One listening on port 443
  - One listening on port 80

.. note::

   Username is Admin and the Password would be part of the Linklight Lab password or in the f5_vars.yml file used to provision the lab.

5. Verify the Website Availability

From a client brower, access the application through the virtual address on the F5 BIG-IP.
- To access this site externally you will need to use the instructor inventory studentX-f5 IP Address which will be refered as (F5-BIG-IP-Public-IP) below.
- If you try to access application on F5-BIG-IP-Public-IP:80 (http://F5-BIG-IP-Public-IP:80), you will be redirected to 443. 
- The same webpage will also be accessible via F5-BIG-IP-Public-IP:443 (https://F5-BIG-IP-Public-IP:443)

.. note::

   Your browser is presented with a certificate (clientssl cert) that is built with the BIG-IP. You will therefore see an ‘unsafe’ message from your browser which is expected in this demo. Click proceed to website.


6. Before moving to the next usecase we need to remove the configuration as we are deploying these usecases as a separated Tenant.

   .. code::
   
      ansible-navigator run delete.yml --mode stdout
