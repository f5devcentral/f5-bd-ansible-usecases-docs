Exercise 3.0 - Introduction to AS3
==================================



Objective
*********

Demonstrate building a virtual server (exactly like the Section 1 Ansible F5 Exercises) with F5 AS3

-  Learn about AS3 (`Application Services 3 Extension <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/userguide/about-as3.html>`__) declarative model. It is not the intention of this exercise to learn AS3 thoroughly, but just give some introduction to the concept and show how it easily integrates with Ansible Playbooks.
-  Learn about the `set_fact module <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/set_fact_module.html>`__
-  Learn about the `uri module <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/uri_module.html>`__

Guide
*****

.. note::
   Make sure the BIG-IP configuration is clean, run exercise `2.1-delete-configuration <../2.1-delete-configuration/README.md>`__ before proceeding

Step 1:
-------

   Examine the ``as3.yml`` in the VSCode editor.
   Expand in the Explorer (f5-bd-ansible-labs --> 101-F5-Basics --> 3.0):

      .. figure:: ../images/bigip-as3-intro.png
         :alt: 

         Examine the Code

Step 2:
-------

Before executing the Playbook, its important to understand how AS3 works. AS3 requires a JSON template to be handed as an API call to F5 BIG-IP. There are two parts:

   - examine the ``tenant_base.j2`` located in the j2 folder

      .. code:: yaml

         {
            "class": "AS3",
            "action": "deploy",
            "persist": true,
            "declaration": {
               "class": "ADC",
               "schemaVersion": "3.2.0",
               "id": "testid",
               "label": "test-label",
               "remark": "test-remark",
               "WorkshopExample":{
                     "class": "Tenant",
                     {{ as3_app_body }}
               }
            }
         }

   ``tenant_base.j2`` is a standard template that can be used to identify a tenant. The important parts to understand are:

      -  ``"WorkshopExample"`` - this is the name of our Tenant. The AS3 will create a tenant for this particular WebApp. A WebApp in this case is a virtual server that load balances between our two web servers.
      -  ``"class": "Tenant"`` - this indicates that ``WorkshopExample`` is a Tenant.
      -  ``{{ as3_app_body }}`` - this is a variable that will point to the second jinja2 template which is the actual WebApp.

   - examine the ``as3_template.j2`` located in the j2 folder

      .. code:: yaml

         "web_app": {
            "class": "Application",
            "template": "http",
            "serviceMain": {
               "class": "Service_HTTP",
               "virtualAddresses": [
                     "{{private_ip}}"
               ],
               "pool": "app_pool"
            },
            "app_pool": {
               "class": "Pool",
               "monitors": [
                     "http"
               ],
               "members": [
                     {
                        "servicePort": 443,
                        "serverAddresses": [
                           {% set comma = joiner(",") %}
                           {% for mem in pool_members %}
                                 {{comma()}} "{{  hostvars[mem]['ansible_host']  }}"
                           {% endfor %}

                        ]
                     }
               ]
            }
         }

   This template is a JSON representation of the Web Application. The important parts to note are:

   -  The template can use variables just like tasks do in previous exercises. In this case the virtual IP address is the private_ip from our inventory.
   -  There is a virtual server named ``serviceMain``.

      -  ``"class": "Service_HTTP"`` - defines the class of application service delivered, in this case its a HTTP Virtual Server.
      -  ``"virtualAddresses":`` - is an array object that contains the variable private_ip which is used for the Virtual Server being created. 
      -  ``"pool": "app_pool"`` - utlizes a pool created further down the template to import the web servers.

   -  There is a Pool named ``app_pool`` The jinja2 template can use a loop to grab all the pool members (which points to our web servers group that will be elaborated on below).

      -  ``"class": "pool"`` - Sets up the pool utilized in the ``serviceMain`` section
      -  ``"monitors":`` - Can utilize a built-in or created monitor (typically created in the AS3 template) to setup proper monitoring for the pool memebers.
      -  ``"members"`` - An arraylist of members and their service ports to attach to the created pool to deliver the application. 

   **In Summary** the ``tenant_base.j2`` and ``as3_template.j2`` create one single JSON payload that represents a Web Application. We will build a Playbook that will send this JSON payload to a F5 BIG-IP.

Step 3:
-------

   Change directories to the exercise 3.0 folder to examine and execute the code in the Terminal

   .. code::

      cd ~/f5-bd-ansible-labs/101-F5-Basics/3.0-as3-intro/

Step 4:
-------

  Run the playbook - Go back to the Terminal on VS Code server on the control host and execute the following:

  .. code::

    ansible-navigator run as3.yml --mode stdout

  **Playbook Output**

  .. code:: yaml

   [rhel-user@ede7a345-c0f1-47f9-a73b-74fded8ec113 3.0-as3-intro]$ ansible-navigator run as3.yml --mode stdout

   }

      "msg": "f5-appsvcs-3.42.0-5.noarch"
   }

   TASK [Remove Previous AS3 Package] *********************************************
   changed: [f5]

   TASK [Install AS3] *************************************************************

   TASK [pause] *******************************************************************
   Pausing for 30 seconds
   (ctrl+C then 'C' = continue early, ctrl+C then 'A' = abort)
   ok: [f5]

   PLAY [AS3 Tenant] **************************************************************

   TASK [CREATE AS3 JSON BODY] ****************************************************
   ok: [f5]

   TASK [PUSH AS3 Template] *******************************************************
   changed: [f5]

   PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
   f5                         : ok=10   changed=4    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
   localhost                  : ok=4    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0 

  .. note::
   
    This code will also install AS3 on the BIG-IP by calling ``- import_playbook: "{{playbook_dir}}/Re-Install-AS3.yaml"`` this just ensures AS3 is installed prior to executing AS3 code.

Solution
********

The finished Ansible Playbook is provided here. Click here: `as3.yml <https://github.com/network-automation/linklight/blob/master/exercises/ansible_f5/3.0-as3-intro/as3.yml>`__.

Verifying the Solution
----------------------

   - Login to the F5 with your web browser to see what was configured. Grab the IP information for the F5 load balancer from the lab_inventory/hosts file, and type it in like so: 

      * **AWS Provisioner** - https://X.X.X.X:8443/
      * **F5 UDF** - https://X.X.X.X:443/

   - Login information for the BIG-IP:

      * username: admin 
      * password: **found in the inventory hosts file**

   - Now your application (Virtual Server/Pool/Nodes) will be fully created and now will be located in the partition ``WorkshopExample``

   .. note:: 

      The Application will be in a Errored State this is expected behavior and will be remediated in Section 3.1

You have finished this exercise.
