Exercise 3.2 - Deleting a Web Application
=========================================



Objective
*********

Demonstrate deleting a Web Application with AS3 and the uri module.

Guide
*****

Step 1:
-------

   Examine the ``delete.yml`` in the VSCode editor.
   Expand in the Explorer (f5-bd-ansible-labs --> 101-F5-Basics --> 3.2-as3-delete):

      .. figure:: ../images/bigip-as3-delete.png
         :alt: 

         Examine the Code

   -  The ``f5networks.f5_bigip.bigip_as3_deploy:`` module is used to push the AS3 Application
   -  The ``tenant`` variable defines the partitions name on the BIG-IP
   -  The ``state`` variable defines when an object is created/modified/deleted

Step 2:
-------

   Change directories to the exercise 3.2 folder to examine and execute the code in the Terminal

   .. code::

      cd ~/f5-bd-ansible-labs/101-F5-Basics/3.2-as3-delete/

Step 3:
-------

  Run the playbook - Go back to the Terminal on VS Code server on the control host and execute the following:

  .. code::

    ansible-navigator run delete.yml --mode stdout

  **Playbook Output**

  .. code:: yaml

   [rhel-user@ede... 3.2-as3-delete]$ ansible-navigator run delete.yml --mode stdout

   PLAY [AS3 Tenant] **************************************************************

   TASK [REMOVE AS3 TENANT] *******************************************************
   changed: [f5]

   PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
   f5                         : ok=1    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   

Solution
********

The finished Ansible Playbook is provided here. Click here: `delete.yml <https://github.com/network-automation/linklight/blob/master/exercises/ansible_f5/3.2-as3-delete/delete.yml>`__.

Verifying the Solution
----------------------

   To see the configured **Tenant Partition**, login to the F5 load balancer with your web browser.

   - BIG-IP - (In UDF Console --> Components --> BIG-IP --> Access --> TMUI)  - This will popup a webpage to access the F5 Login Page

      * Login to the BIG-IP instance

           + username: admin 
           + password: **found in the inventory hosts file**

   - Now your application (Virtual Server/Pool/Nodes) will be fully deleted and the partition ``WorkshopExample`` will be deleted as well.

You have finished this exercise.
