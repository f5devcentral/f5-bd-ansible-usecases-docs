==========================================



Objective
*********

Demonstrate changing an existing Web Application AS3 template. There is a problem with the existing template, the serviceMain is showing red. What is wrong?

Guide
*****

Step 1:
-------

   Figure out what is wrong. Login to the F5 with your web browser to see what was configured.

   1. Click on ``ServiceMain`` to see why its down.
   2. Look at the ``Availability`` field in the table.

      .. figure:: ../images/pool-nodes-down.png
         :alt: pool-nodes-down.png

   3. Click on the ``Pools`` under ``Local Traffic``
   4. Click on ``app_pool``
   5. Click on the ``Members`` button

      .. figure:: ../images/443.png
         :alt: 443

   The port **443** is incorrect. The two RHEL web servers are only running on port 80. This is why they are showing down.

Step 2:
-------

Now we are going to look at what changed in the ``as3_template.j2`` file as we have modified the service port from 443 to 80 and this is the only change made to the AS3 template

   - examine the ``as3_template.j2`` located in the j2 folder

      .. code:: yaml

         "web_app": {
            "class": "Application",
            "template": "http",
            "serviceMain": {
               "class": "Service_HTTP",
               "virtualAddresses": [
                     "{{private_ip}}"
               ],
               "pool": "app_pool"
            },
            "app_pool": {
               "class": "Pool",
               "monitors": [
                     "http"
               ],
               "members": [
                     {
                        "servicePort": 80,
                        "serverAddresses": [
                           {% set comma = joiner(",") %}
                           {% for mem in pool_members %}
                                 {{comma()}} "{{  hostvars[mem]['ansible_host']  }}"
                           {% endfor %}

                        ]
                     }
               ]
            }
         }

Step 3:
-------

   Change directories to the exercise 3.0 folder to examine and execute the code in the Terminal

   .. code::

      cd ~/f5-bd-ansible-labs/101-F5-Basics/3.1-as3-change/

Step 4:
-------

  Run the playbook - Go back to the Terminal on VS Code server on the control host and execute the following:

  .. code::

    ansible-navigator run as3.yml --mode stdout

  **Playbook Output**

  .. code:: yaml

   [rhel-user@ede... 3.1-as3-change]$ ansible-navigator run as3.yml --mode stdout

   PLAY [AS3 Tenant Change] *******************************************************

   TASK [CREATE AS3 JSON BODY] ****************************************************
   ok: [f5]

   TASK [PUSH AS3 Template] *******************************************************
   changed: [f5]

   PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
   f5                         : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   

  .. note::
   
    This code doesn't have the ``- import_playbook: "{{playbook_dir}}/Re-Install-AS3.yaml"`` as we do not need AS3 re-installed, the rest of as3.yml is the same.

Solution
********

The finished Ansible Playbook is provided here. Click here: `as3_template.j2 <https://github.com/network-automation/linklight/blob/master/exercises/ansible_f5/3.1-as3-change/j2/as3_template.j2>`__.

Verifying the Solution
----------------------

   - Login to the F5 with your web browser to see what was configured. Grab the IP information for the F5 load balancer from the lab_inventory/hosts file, and type it in like so: 

      * **AWS Provisioner** - https://X.X.X.X:8443/
      * **F5 UDF** - https://X.X.X.X:443/

   - Login information for the BIG-IP:

      * username: admin 
      * password: **found in the inventory hosts file**

   - Now your application will be fully fuctional and the (Pools members) fixed to utilize port 80 instead of port 443 within the partition ``WorkshopExample``
