Guide
-----

Step 1:
~~~~~~~

Figure out what is wrong. Login to the F5 with your web browser to see
what was configured.

1. Click on ``ServiceMain`` to see why its down.
2. Look at the ``Availability`` field in the table.

3. Click on the ``Pools`` under ``Local Traffic``
4. Click on ``app_pool``
5. Click on the ``Members`` button

.. figure:: 443.png
   :alt: 443

   443

The port **443** is incorrect. The two RHEL web servers are only running
on port 80. This is why they are showing down.

Step 2:
~~~~~~~

Open the existing jinja template ``as3_template.j2`` in the ~/j2
directory

Step 3:
~~~~~~~

Find where the port **443** is and modify it to port **80**.

The line looks as follows-> {% raw %}

.. code:: json

                   "servicePort": 443,

{% endraw %}

change it to->

{% raw %}

.. code:: json

                   "servicePort": 80,

{% endraw %}

Step 4:
~~~~~~~

Run the playbook - Go back to the Terminal on VS Code server on the
control host and execute the following:

::

   [student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-navigator run as3.yml --mode stdout

Playbook Output
---------------

The output will look as follows.

{% raw %}

.. code:: yaml

   [student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-navigator as3.yml --mode stdout

   PLAY [Linklight AS3] **********************************************************

   TASK [Create AS3 JSON Body] ***************************************************
   ok: [f5]

   TASK [Push AS3] ***************************************************************
   ok: [f5]

   PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
   f5                         : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0

{% endraw %}

Solution
--------

The fixed Jinja template is provided here for an Answer key. Click here:
`as3_template.j2 <https://github.com/network-automation/linklight/blob/master/exercises/ansible_f5/3.1-as3-change/j2/as3_template.j2>`__.

Verifying the Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Login to the F5 with your web browser to see what was configured. Grab
the IP information for the F5 load balancer from the lab_inventory/hosts
file, and type it in like so: https://X.X.X.X:8443/

.. figure:: as3-fix.gif
   :alt: f5 gui as3

   f5 gui as3

1. Click on the Local Traffic on the lefthand menu
2. Click on Virtual Servers.
3. On the top right, click on the drop down menu titled ``Partition``
   and select WorkshopExample
4. The Virtual Server ``serviceMain`` will be displayed.
5. This time it will be Green
   (``Available (Enabled) - The virtual server is available``)
6. Verify under ``Pools`` for ``app_pool`` that both web servers are set
   to port **80** for their ``service_port``
