Exercise 2.0 - Disabling a pool member
======================================



Objective
*********

For this last exercise instead of prescriptive step-by-step walkthrough a framework of objectives with hints for each step will be provided.

Demonstrate the removal of a node from the pool. Build a Playbook that:

   - Retrieve Facts from BIG-IP for the pools present on the BIG-IP (in our example only one pool is present) 
   - Display pools available - Store the pool name as a fact - Display all the pool members that belong to the pool => IP and port information to the terminal window 
   - Prompt the user to disable a particular member or disable all members of the pool 
   - Force the appropriate pool members offline


Guide
*****

Step 1:
-------

   Examine the ``disabled-pool-member.yml`` in the VSCode editor.
   Expand in the Explorer (f5-bd-ansible-labs --> 101-F5-Basics --> 2.0-disable-pool-member):

      .. figure:: ../images/bigip-disable-pool-member-examine.png
         :alt: 

         Examine the Code

   -  The ``bigip_device_info:`` is the module for displaying information from the BIG-IP. Everything except ``register`` is a module parameter defined on the module documentation page.
   -  The ``debug:`` module is used to display output from variables or other items like queries.
   -  The ``set_fact:`` module is used to create variables used within the playbook.
   -  The ``bigip_pool_member:`` is the module for adding/modifying/deleting pool members on the BIG-IP.

   -  The ``provider:`` parameter is a group of connection details for the BIG-IP.

      *  The ``server: "{{ ansible_host }}"`` parameter tells the module to connect to the F5 BIG-IP IP address, which is stored as a variable ``ansible_host`` in inventory
      *  The ``user: "{{ ansible_user }}"`` parameter tells the module the username to login to the F5 BIG-IP device with
      *  The ``password: "{{ ansible_password }}"`` parameter tells the module the password to login to the F5 BIG-IP device with
      *  The ``server_port: "{{ server_port }}`` parameter tells the module the port to connect to the F5 BIG-IP device with
      *  The ``validate_certs: false`` parameter tells the module to not validate SSL certificates. This is just used for demonstration purposes since this is a lab.


Step 2:
-------

   Change directories to the exercise 2.0 folder to examine and execute the code in the Terminal

   .. code::

      cd ~/f5-bd-ansible-labs/101-F5-Basics/2.0-disable-pool-member/

Step 3:
-------

   Run the playbook - Go back to the Terminal on VS Code server on the control host and execute the following:

   .. code::

      ansible-navigator run disable-pool-member.yml --mode stdout

   **Playbook Output**

   .. code:: yaml

      [rhel-user@ede... 2.0-disable-pool-member]$ ansible-navigator run disable-pool-member.yml --mode stdout

Solution
********

The finished Ansible Playbook is provided here. Click here `disable-pool-member.yml <https://github.com/ansible/workshops/blob/master/exercises/ansible_f5/2.0-disable-pool-member/disable-pool-member.yml>`__.

Verifying the Solution
----------------------

   - Login to the F5 with your web browser to see what was configured. Grab the IP information for the F5 load balancer from the lab_inventory/hosts file, and type it in like so: 

      * **AWS Provisioner** - https://X.X.X.X:8443/
      * **F5 UDF** - https://X.X.X.X:443/

   - Login information for the BIG-IP:

      * username: admin 
      * password: **found in the inventory hosts file**

   - The pool will now show two members (node1 and node2) with both nodes are disabled. Click on Local Traffic-> Pools --> Click on http_pool -->  to get more granular information. Click on the Members tab in the middle to list all the Members.
