Exercise 1.0: Exploring the lab environment
===========================================

Before you get started, please join us on slack! `Click here to join the ansiblenetwork slack <https://join.slack.com/t/ansiblenetwork/shared_invite/zt-3zeqmhhx-zuID9uJqbbpZ2KdVeTwvzw>`__. This will allow you to chat with other network automation engineers and get help after the workshops concludes.


Objective
---------

Explore and understand the lab environment.

These first few lab exercises will be exploring the command-line
utilities of the Ansible Automation Platform. This includes

   -  `ansible-navigator <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator>`__
      - a command line utility and text-based user interface (TUI) for
      running and developing Ansible automation content.
   -  `ansible-core <https://docs.ansible.com/core.html>`__ - the base
      executable that provides the framework, language and functions that
      underpin the Ansible Automation Platform. It also includes various
      cli tools like ``ansible``, ``ansible-playbook`` and ``ansible-doc``.
      Ansible Core acts as the bridge between the upstream community with
      the free and open source Ansible and connects it to the downstream
      enterprise automation offering from Red Hat, the Ansible Automation
      Platform.
   -  `Execution
      Environments <https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/execution_environments.html>`__
      - not specifically covered in this workshop because the built-in
      Ansible Execution Environments already included all the Red Hat
      supported collections which includes all the network collections we
      use for this workshop. Execution Environments are container images
      that can be utilized as Ansible execution.
   -  `ansible-builder <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder>`__ -
      not specifically covered in this workshop, ``ansible-builder`` is a
      command line utility to automate the process of building Execution
      Environments.

Guide
-----

Step 1 - Connecting via VS Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. note:: 

      It is highly encouraged to use Visual Studio Code to complete the
      workshop exercises. Visual Studio Code provides:

         - A file browser
         - A text editor with syntax highlighting
         - A in-browser terminal

|

   Direct SSH access is available as a backup, or if Visual Studio Code is not sufficient to the student.  
   There is a short YouTube video provided if you need additional clarity: `Ansible Workshops <https://youtu.be/Y_Gx4ZBfcuk>`_ - Accessing your workbench environment.
|   
-  Connect to Visual Studio Code from the F5 UDF components page . The password is provided below the WebUI link.

   .. figure:: ../images/launch_page_udf.png 
      :alt: launch page

|

-  Type in the provided password to connect.

   .. figure:: ../images/vscode_login.png
      :alt: login vs code

|

-  Open the ``User Directory`` directory in Visual Studio Code, (File --> Open Folder --> Ensure that the user ``rhel-user`` is selected or part of the path and then Click OK).

   .. figure:: ../images/vscode-f5workshop-fix.png
      :alt: picture of file browser

|

-  This would be ``/home/rhel-user`` once connected it will give a *Trust Warning* ``Check the box`` and click ``Yes, I trust the authors``

   .. figure:: ../images/trust_udf.png
      :alt: trust connection

|

-  From here on the left pane you can click on the individual exercise
   folders and then click on the ``yaml`` files to check the content of
   the files.

|

Step 2 - Using the Terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code (Terminal --> New Terminal)

   .. figure:: ../images/vscode-new-terminal.png
      :alt: picture of new terminal

|

-  Navigate to the ``f5-bd-ansible-labs`` and the ``101-F5-Basics`` directories on the Ansible control node 
   terminal and run the ``pwd`` command to verify you are in the correct directory


   .. code:: bash

      cd ~/f5-bd-ansible-labs/101-F5-Basics/


   .. code:: bash
      
      pwd 

|

   **The Output should look something like**

   .. code-block:: console

      [rhel-user@ede... ~]$ ~/f5-bd-ansible-labs/101-F5-Basics/
      [rhel-user@ede... 101-F5-Basics]$ pwd
      /home/rhel-user/f5-bd-ansible-labs/101-F5-Basics
      [rhel-user@ede... 101-F5-Basics]$


   -  ``~`` - the tilde in this context is a shortcut for the home
      directory, i.e.Â ``/home/student1``
   -  ``cd`` - Linux command to change directory
   -  ``pwd`` - Linux command for print working directory. This will show
      the full path to the current working directory.

|

Step 3 - Examining Execution Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Run the ``ansible-navigator`` command with the ``images`` argument to look at execution environments configured on the control node:

   .. code:: bash

      ansible-navigator images

   .. figure:: ../images/navigator-images.png
      :alt: ansible-navigator images

   ..

      Note: The output you see might differ from the above output

- This command gives you information about all currently installed Execution Environments or EEs for short. Investigate an EE by pressing the corresponding number. 

   .. figure:: ../images/navigator-ee-menu.png
      :alt: ee main menu



- Selecting ``2`` for ``Ansible version and collections`` will show us all Ansible Collections installed on that particular EE, and the version of ``ansible-core``:

   .. figure:: ../images/navigator-ee-collections.png
      :alt: ee info


- When completed keep pressing ``ESC`` many times or type ``:quit`` to quit out of the ansible-navigator menus

|

Step 4 - Examining the ansible-navigator configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Either use Visual Studio Code to open or use the ``cat`` command to view the contents of the ``ansible-navigator.yml`` file. The file is located in the home directory:

   .. code:: bash

      cat ~/.ansible-navigator.yml



   **Output should look something like**
   
   .. code-block:: console

      ---
      ansible-navigator:
      ansible:
         inventory:
            entries:
            - /home/rhel-user/lab_inventory/hosts
      execution-environment:
         container-engine: podman
         enabled: true
         image: quay.io/f5_business_development/f5_ee:latest
         #image: quay.io/f5_business_development/f5_ee_static_build:latest  # This is a backup image with a static build of collections known to work 
         pull:
            policy: missing
         volume-mounts:
         - dest: /tmp/f5/
            src: /f5/code-output/
         - dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/asm-profiles
            src: /usr/share/nginx/html/asm-profiles
|

- Note the following parameters within the ``ansible-navigator.yml`` file:

   -  ``inventories``: shows the location of the ansible inventory being
      used
   -  ``execution-environment``: where the default execution environment is
      set
   -  ``volume-mounts``: where local system folders are being passed through
      to the cotainer envrionemnt to migrate items outside of the container.

   For a full listing of every configurable knob checkout the
   `documentation <https://ansible-navigator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings/>`__

|

Step 5 - Examining inventory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The scope of a ``play`` within a ``playbook`` is limited to the groups
   of hosts declared within an Ansible **inventory**. Ansible supports
   multiple
   `inventory <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html>`__
   types. An inventory could be a simple flat file with a collection of
   hosts defined within it or it could be a dynamic script (potentially
   querying a CMDB backend) that generates a list of devices to run the
   playbook against.

   In this lab you will work with a file based inventory written in the
   **ini** format. Either use Visual Studio Code to open or use the ``cat``
   command to view the contents of the ``~/lab_inventory/hosts`` file.

   .. code:: bash

      cat ~/lab_inventory/hosts

   .. code:: bash

      [all:vars]
      ansible_user=rhel-user
      ansible_password=Ansible123!
      ansible_port=22
      ansible_become_pass="{{ ansible_password }}"
      lab_version="udf"
      ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

      [lb]
      f5 ansible_host=10.1.1.7 ansible_user=admin private_ip=10.1.20.30 ansible_password=Ansible123! server_port=443

      [control]
      ansible ansible_host=10.1.1.4 ansible_user=rhel-user private_ip=10.1.1.4 

      [web]
      node1 ansible_host=10.1.1.5 ansible_user=rhel-user private_ip=10.1.10.5
      node2 ansible_host=10.1.1.6 ansible_user=rhel-user private_ip=10.1.10.6
|

Step 6 - Understanding inventory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In the above output every ``[ ]`` defines a group. For example ``[web]``
   is a group that contains the hosts ``node1`` and ``node2``.

      Note: A group called **all** always exists and contains all groups
      and hosts defined within an inventory.

   We can associate variables to groups and hosts. Host variables are
   declared/defined on the same line as the host themselves. For example
   for the host ``f5``:

   ``f5 ansible_host=34.199.128.69 ansible_user=admin private_ip=172.16.26.136 ansible_password=admin``

   -  ``f5`` - The name that Ansible will use. This can but does not have
      to rely on DNS
   -  ``ansible_host`` - The IP address that ansible will use, if not
      configured it will default to DNS
   -  ``ansible_user`` - The user ansible will use to login to this host,
      if not configured it will default to the user the playbook is run
      from
   -  ``private_ip`` - This value is not reserved by ansible so it will
      default to a `host
      variable <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html#host-variables>`__.
      This variable can be used by playbooks or ignored completely.
   -  ``ansible_password`` - The password ansible will use to login to this
      host, if not configured it will assume the user the playbook ran from
      has access to this host through SSH keys.

   ..

      Does the password have to be in plain text? No, Red Hat Ansible Tower
      can take care of credential management in an easy to use web GUI or a
      user may use
      `ansible-vault <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/first_inventory.html#protecting-sensitive-variables-with-ansible-vault>`__

|

Step 7 - Using ansible-navigator to explore inventory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   We can also use the ``ansible-navigator`` TUI to explore inventory.

- Run the ansible-navigator inventory command to bring up inventory in the TUI:

   .. code:: 

      ansible-navigator inventory


   .. figure:: ../images/navigator_tui.png
      :alt: ansible-navigator tui

      ansible-navigator tui


- Pressing **0** or **1** on your keyboard will open groups or hosts respectively.

   .. figure:: ../images/navigator_groups.png
      :alt: ansible-navigator groups

      ansible-navigator groups


- Press the **Esc** key to go up a level, or press corisponding number to zoom in to a host (within a group or within hosts):

   .. figure:: ../images/ansible-navigator-rtr.png
      :alt: ansible-navigator host

      ansible-navigator host


- Quit the TUI using the ``:quit`` command or continue pressing ``ESC``
